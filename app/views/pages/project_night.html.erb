      Project Night is a great night to get help getting Rails installed on your system,
      work on and get help with your own project, hack on some open source, and meet other
      Rubyists in the Boston area.</br>
      <br/>
      We also have informal workshops to help introduce you to good programming practices, work
      with different gems, and learn more about Ruby and Rails.
